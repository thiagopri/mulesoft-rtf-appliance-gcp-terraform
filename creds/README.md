# Credentials Folder

This is the folder where you should keep your credential files. These files are referenced on the main script based on the environment's specific properties file.

The files should be in the JSON-KEY format generated by GCP.

For security reasons, json files posted on this folder will not be considered in your git flow (as it is included in .gitgnore file).
